Initial guide here - https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/

The basics:
in each terminal, run: 
	export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi

To start a turtlebot in a world: 
	roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_house.launch
To start outputting sensor data: 
	roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_gazebo_rviz.launch
To control over keyboard: 
	roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch

This can be run with multiple turtlebots. Each bot will have /tb3_{#} as the start of all topic genetated by that robot, ex: /tb3_2/cmd_vel. Normal launch files/other can be used, by starting the command with ROS_NAMESPACE=tb3_{#}. To start the sample multi-bot simulation (house with 3): 
	roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo multi_turtlebot3.launch
Then you can enact normal commands such as:
	ROS_NAMESPACE=tb3_0 rosrun turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key

all topics created with a turtlebot: 
/camera/parameter_descriptions
/camera/parameter_updates

/scan
/tf

Notes:
/cmd_vel - Publish to this topic to control the robot
/camera/rgb/image-raw - ~30fps images from the turtlebot's camera
/scan - ~5/sec lidar scans
/imu - IMU data
/joint_states - Looks like wheel rotations

Editing robot parameters:
Look in ~/simulation_ws/src/turtlebot3/turtlebot3_description/urdf
for: turtlebot3_burger.urdf.xacro and turtlebot3_burger.gazebo.xacro
These files contain the physical and sensor definitions, including camera fov/framerate/resolution
